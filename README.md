### House-Price-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning

This is an example of how to use Python to predict house prices. Libraries used:
a) Pandas - To load my csv file
b) Numpy - To check which features impact the price the most 
c) Sklearn (sklearn.preprocessing) - To split my data into training and testing sets (using train_test_split), normalise my continuous values (using StandardScaler),train the model (using LinearRegression)
d) Matplotlib - To visualise my output
